# Poetic Text Generation with RNNs
This project uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to generate new poetic texts in the style of Shakespeare. An LSTM model is trained on a dataset of Shakespeare's works to learn patterns in language and generate new passages character-by-character.

# Project Description
Generating realistic yet novel poetic texts is a challenging task for artificial intelligence. RNNs are well-suited for this because they can learn sequential patterns in language over long periods of time. This model demonstrates how LSTMs can capture the rhythm, vocabulary and flow of Shakespearean poetry after training on a large corpus.
